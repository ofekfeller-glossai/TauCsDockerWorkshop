Hello everyone and welcome to the workshop!

It is very important that you will have Docker downloaded and working on your computer before the workshop,
so we will be able to jump right in and focus on the important stuff.

Please follow this simple turtorial, it shouldnt take more than few minutes:
https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/

After you finished downloading docker, run the following 2 commands to make sure it is installed successfully on your computer-

`docker pull hello-world`

`docker run hello-world`

That's it for the meanwhile, see you next Sunday!
