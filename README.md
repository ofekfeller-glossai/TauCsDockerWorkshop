# TAU CS Docker Workshop
Hello everyone and welcome to the workshop!

It is very important that you will have Docker downloaded and working on your computer before the workshop,
so we will be able to jump right in and focus on the important stuff.

Please follow the instructions and requirements below, it really shouldnt take that long.

# Technical Requirements

- Docker: Using the official turtorial: https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/
- Python: Make sure also `pip install` is working
- IDE: VSCode, Pycharm or any other

# Test Docker 

After you finished downloading docker, run the following 2 commands to make sure it is installed successfully on your computer-

`docker pull hello-world`

`docker run hello-world`

If everything goes right, you should get hello message from Docker at the end.

That's it for the meanwhile, see you next Sunday!
